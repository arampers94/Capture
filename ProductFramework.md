# Product Framework
This application is intended to be a note taking app, that incentivizes its use. Our problem will solve the issue of students
not taking their notes in class due to getting sidetracked or being lazy by giving them motivation to use the app by providing tasks
and rewards for their actions in the application. We know our product works when we see users completing multiple goals, because that
means they are using the app and efficiently taking notes.
